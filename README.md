## 📌 About the Project

This project is an intelligent assistant designed to solve mathematical word problems and answer general knowledge questions. Built with **Streamlit**, it provides a clean and user-friendly chat interface. The backend is powered by **Groq's** high-speed inference engine running the **Gemma 2** model, ensuring quick and accurate responses. **LangChain** is used to create a sophisticated agent equipped with multiple tools, including a calculator, a Wikipedia search tool, and a reasoning engine to break down complex problems.

## ✨ Key Features
  * **Natural Language Problem Solving:**  Understands and solves math word problems written in plain English.
  * **Multi-Tool Agent:** Employs a LangChain agent that can perform calculations, search Wikipedia for information, and provide detailed, step-by-step reasoning for its answers.
  * **High-Speed Inference:** Leverages Groq's API for extremely fast response times, creating a smooth user experience.
  * **Interactive UI:** A simple and intuitive chat interface built with Streamlit.
  * **Transparent Process:** The agent's thought process is displayed, allowing users to see how it arrives at a solution.
